# Decision-Tree-Classifier

This repository contains a simple implementation of a **Decision-Tree-Classifier** using Python and scikit-learn.  
It demonstrates how to train, evaluate, and visualize a decision tree model for classification tasks.

## 📌 **Project Description**

In this project, I trained a Decision Tree Classifier on the popular **Iris dataset** to predict the species of iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements.

The project includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training with scikit-learn
- Model evaluation using accuracy and F1-score
- Tree visualization with `plot_tree`
